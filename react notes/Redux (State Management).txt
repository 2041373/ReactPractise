Redux (State Managment)

What is Redux? 
- it is a state Managmentlibrary for react 
- it provides a predictable and centralised way to manage the state of an applicaiton 

3 principles of redux: 
- single source of truth: the state of an applicaton is stored in a single JavaScript object called the state tree
- state is read-only: the only way to change the state is by dispatching an action 
- changes are made with pure functions: reducers take the previous state and an action, and return the next state 

benefits of redux 
- predictable state management 
- easier debugging and testing 
- centralised state makes it easier to reason about the application 

when to use redux 
- large applciations with complex state management 
- applications with mnay compoenents that need to share data 
- applications that require undo/redo funcationality
